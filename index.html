              <h3>Japan, a dream travel destination</h3>
              <p>
                Japan is full of many unique and diverse places waiting to be
                visited. From its advanced modern cities, to its mountain
                regions, there is something for everyone. There is so much to
                explore throughout the country that it is often difficult to
                prioritze what you really want to explore. You can stay in a
                city in Japan for your entire trip and still not see all of what
                the city has to offer. When is it the best time to visit? If I
                could, I would visit Japan during every season. There is
                something different to see in all 4 seasons such as the sakura
                trees blooming in the spring to watching snow monkeys bathe in
                hot springs in the winter. Choosing when to visit is a difficult
                query within itself, let alone what to do in Japan. This is what
                makes the country so amazing; it is a once in a lifetime
                opportunity to visit Japan.

              <h3>Tokyo</h3>
              <p>
                Tokyo is the city that many think of when they think of Japan.
                There are sub districts within Tokyo that offer a variety of
                enjoyment such as Akihabara, the main focal point of Japanese
                pop culture as well as Harajuku, the center of Japan’s amazing
                and unique fashion. You can also find unique restaurants such as
                a Pokemon cafe where there are dancing Pikachu mascots and many
                maid cafes.

              <h3>Kyoto</h3>
              <p>
                Kyoto is the city that is home to many of Japan’s ancient
                temples, palaces, and shrines. It is worth visiting some of
                these temples as you can experience first hand the traditions.
                There are also many places within Kyoto that have beautiful
                natural scenery such as a bamboo grove in Arashiyama. You can
                visit the many tea houses that Kyoto has to offer as well as
                possibly seeing a working geisha.

              <p>
                Osaka is a city full of nightlife. There are a lot of themed
                bars you can find here like video game bars. Many of Japan’s
                famous dishes originated from this city. It is a must to taste
                dishes like takoyaki, okonomiyaki and yakisoba here. You can
                also find the infamous Osaka castle and the accompanying park.
                The park has over 500 cherry blossom trees, perfect to visit and
                picnic here in the springtime.

            <p>
              Hi! My name is Alejandra and I created this page so I can further
              develop my coding skills. I decided to do a landing page on my
              dream travel destination: Japan. There are so many things to do
              and places to visit in Japan that I hope I can do one day. Thank
              you for coming along this journey with me.
            </p>
